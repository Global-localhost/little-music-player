A simple tiny audio player.
Plays audios and videos, like how you expected to.
Designed in hope for compatibility with different android versions.

"Specialities":
- less than 20kB in size, one of the tiniest audio player apps
- Theoretical support starting from android 1.0
- Tested support on android 2.3 and higher
- clean, simple design
- plays audio and nothing else, just like how it should be
- minimal permission required, so you know it's safe to use
- supports all audio types that your system's decoder supports
- as little third-party library used as possible
- open-sourced, everyone should have the right to listen to music


if you worry about size, compatibility or privacy, this is the app to use!

We use the permission Foreground Service to provide audio playing while using other apps.

The app is still under development, changes may be common.
Issues and pull requests are welcomed.
